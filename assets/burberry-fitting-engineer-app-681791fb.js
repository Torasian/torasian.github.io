The app allows engineers to capture detailed measurements, take photos, and log amendments in real-time, significantly reducing the time spent on paperwork and improving accuracy.

Key challenges included ensuring offline functionality for factory environments with limited connectivity, implementing a robust image capture system, and creating an intuitive interface for quick data entry. The solution resulted in a 60% reduction in documentation time and a 40% decrease in errors.`,g={discovery:"Conducted extensive user research with fitting engineers to understand their workflow and pain points",design:"Created wireframes and prototypes focusing on quick data entry and offline functionality",development:"Built a hybrid mobile app using Ionic and Angular, with a Node.js backend",testing:"Implemented comprehensive testing across various devices and network conditions",deployment:"Rolled out the app to all Burberry manufacturing facilities with training sessions"},h="https://example.com/video.mp4",y={time_saved:"60%",error_reduction:"40%",user_adoption:"95%"},f={quote:"The app has transformed how our fitting engineers work, making the process more efficient and accurate.",author:"Sarah Johnson",position:"Head of Quality Control, Burberry"},v=!0,w="Client Technical Excellence Award",b={slug:e,project_title:n,description:t,institution:i,company_logo:o,hero_image:r,industry:a,my_role:s,client_name:c,year:2023,date:l,skills:p,tools:d,images:m,main_content:u,process:g,project_video:h,metrics:y,testimonial:f,featured:v,award:w};export{w as award,c as client_name,o as company_logo,l as date,b as default,t as description,v as featured,r as hero_image,m as images,a as industry,i as institution,u as main_content,y as metrics,s as my_role,g as process,n as project_title,h as project_video,p as skills,e as slug,f as testimonial,d as tools,_ as year};

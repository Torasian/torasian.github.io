    "main_content": "The Burberry Fitting Engineer App was developed to revolutionize how fitting engineers document and track garment amendments. The app allows engineers to capture detailed measurements, take photos, and log amendments in real-time, significantly reducing the time spent on paperwork and improving accuracy.\n\nKey challenges included ensuring offline functionality for factory environments with limited connectivity, implementing a robust image capture system, and creating an intuitive interface for quick data entry. The solution resulted in a 60% reduction in documentation time and a 40% decrease in errors.",
